Parameter values from homeostasis/mallostasis paper

Pridham, G. & Rutenberg, A. D. Network dynamical stability analysis reveals key ‘mallostatic’ natural variables that erode homeostasis and drive age-related decline of health. Sci. Rep. 13, 1–12 (2023)

4 datasets: slam_c57, slam_het3, paquid and elsa
bs is for bootstrap
se is for standard errors
parameters:
1. W is network
2. lambda are the linear parameters for the covariates
3. sigma is the noise matrix
  a. default includes imputated values without correction
  b. "scaled" are scaled by number of imputed values - not recommended that you use this (in principle it's better but values don't look right)
4. yinit_mu is the initial mean for the biomarkers in W
5. yinit_cov is the initial covariance for the biomarkers in W
6. xinit_mu is the initial mean for the covariates (used in lambda)
7. xinit_cov is the initial covariance for the covariates (used in lambda)

Note: ELSA didn't have some variables at initial wave, so the 'init' values are for the LAST wave, not the first. (Also, SLAM is technically the 2nd wave, although this distinction shouldn't matter much)


The average step sizes (in appropriate units - in paper) were:
slam_c57 (weeks?): 6.387097
slam_het3 (weeks?): 4.943421
paquid (years): 3.210585
elsa (years): 3.939907
