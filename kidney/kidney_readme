Useful files from

Systems-level characterization of health in patients
living with end-stage kidney disease using standard
lab values


The beta files are the emulator for computing natural variables using a limited set of variables. The naming convention is:
kidney_emulator_convenience_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients.csv.

I have also included errors for these estimators which are in files named:
kidney_emulator_convenience_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients_errors.csv.
