# For simulations
The simulation files are:
-sim_y0cov.csv #covariance matrix for initial biomarker values
-sim_x0cov.csv #covariance matrix for initial covariate values
-sim_initial_mean.csv #provides the initial means for each biomarker and covariate
-sim_W.csv #the W parameter matrix (network) used for simulations
-sim_lambda.csv #the lambda parameter matrix (mu) used for simulations (excludes mu0, this is covariates only)
-sim_mu0.csv #the mu0 parameter matrix used for simulations
-sim_sigma.csv #the noise parameter matrix (sigma) used for simulations

To use the SF model simulator you'd use:
#sample yinit from a normal random variable
#sample xinit from a normal random variable, then generate x by stepping it forward in time by dt = 6/52
#then use:
sim = GenSF(N=N,x=x,lambda=lambda,W=W,mu0=mu0,times=times,dt=dt,noiseCov=sigma,y0 = yinit)

Death can then be imposed afterwards using the death parameter files:
#from library(eha), use coef() to get the needed coefficients
#the ones with "z" at the end use the z natural variables, for which you'll have to transform your simulation into z via the eigendecomposition of W
  #i.e. Pinv = solve(eigen(W)[[2]]) #this will transform z = y%*%t(Pinv) for matrix of individuals y into matrix of natural variables z #(you'll probably want to sort eigenvalues first)
-anova_optimized_phreg.rds #for death
-anova_optimized_phreg_censor.rds #for censorship
-anova_optimized_phreg_transplant.rds #for transplant
Simple step through each time in sim, and sample from a Weibull distribution the event time from each of these three possible events. Reject any which occur after the next timestep. Keep whichever one happens first.

# Natural variables
The vignette (vignette_using_the_coefficients) explains how to compute the natural variables given a set of biomarkers. Ideally you'll have all 14 used in the paper, otherwise you'll need to use the emulator.

There are three cases for computing the natural variables:
1. you have all 14 biomarkers,
2. you have a subset of the 14, or
3. you have a subset of the 6 validation set (creatinine, albumin, urea, phosphate, calcium, total_co2).
These are delineated below and explained in the vignette.

# Case 1: you have all 14 biomarkers
You'll need the Pinv transformation matrix and the scale parameters:
natural_variable_transformation_Pinv_real.csv
natural_variable_transformation_Pinv_imaginary.csv
kidney_data_mu.csv
kidney_data_sd.csv

# Case 2: you have some of the 14 biomarkers
The coefficients (''beta'') files are saved using the convention:
kidney_emulator_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients.csv

I have also included errors for these estimators which are in files named:
kidney_emulator_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients_errors.csv.

# Case 3: you have some of the 6 validation set biomarkers (may be more accurate than case 2)
The beta files are the emulator for computing natural variables using a limited set of variables. The naming convention is:
kidney_emulator_convenience_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients.csv.

I have also included errors for these estimators which are in files named:
kidney_emulator_convenience_models_<natural variable to estimate>_coefficients_errors.csv.
